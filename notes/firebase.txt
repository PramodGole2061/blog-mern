*To implement firebase for google O auth
1. search google firebase, log in, click on go to console
2. create a new project
3. click on + or add app button to find options for mobile, web etc,
4. click on web or </> button
5. give a name for the web app, do not click on checkbox there i forgot what it was.
6. go Add Firebase SDK, choose npm , install firebase on your project with the given npm for installing  
   of course install the npm inside the client/frontend as well
7. create a file and paste the given code there, this should be in the root of src with file name like firebase.js 
8. api_key inside firebase.js should be a secret so use .env to hide it. however in the tutorial, it was advised to 
    create another .env file inside root of client/frontend and start the name of a key with VITE like VITE_API_KEY
    becasue it is a vite react app. although for now i am testing if it will work normally if i just use the usual .env file
    update: it failed. also while importing inside client/frontend/react app use: import.meta.env.VITE_EXAMPLE_KEY
9. export the app at the end of the code, so that it can be imported on other pages and used
10. click go to console
11. find authentication, click on it, click get started, click on google button, click enable button on top right, give project name, your email
    and click on save. it will enable google authentiation 
12. search google auth provider, go to Google cloud documentation, go to signing in users with google part
    there is examples or some bits and parts of example there.
13. const resultFromGoogle = signInWithPopUp(provider, auth);
